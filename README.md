Hello, congrats on being identified as a potential employee of Swipe. You were sent this skills assessment as a way to identify your current strengths and weaknesses as a potential hire for Swipe as a QA Engineer. Doing well on this assessment is absolutely critical to receiving a job offer.

# Rules
1. It should only take about 1-2 hours to complete the assessment. If you need more time, that is allowed, however the amount of time from your first commit to last will be used to assess you as a candidate for the position. Only start the assessment when you are ready to give it your full attention.
2. You may use any code or text editor to complete the assessment you choose. We recommend Visual Studio Code as a free choice.
3. You may use any programming language, library or framework to complete the assessment.
4. You may consult anybody and anything to help you with your assessment, including google, developer documentation, stackoverflow, etc. However, it will be apparent if you use copy-pasta code, and your unique code style will be part of your assessment.
5. If you use others' code (i.e. Stack overflow answers), make sure you credit the author/answer in comments inline with your work.
